# My 339 Homework
These are my solutions to the homework assignments for CprE 339 which is Software Architecture and Design.
Each assignment contains the following:
  - Java code (in a .zip in some cases)
  - Pdf instructions provided by the instructor
  - Word document detailing my design decisions

I'm starting this a bit late in the semester and the assignments build off of each other, so this repo only contains assignments 2 and 3 and from assignment 5 onward.
